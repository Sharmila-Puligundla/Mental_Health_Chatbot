### Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used for development.
- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework for serving the chatbot.
- **Pinecone**: A vector database for storing and querying embeddings.
- **OpenAI**: For generating responses to user queries.
- **LangChain**: For managing the interaction between the chatbot and the vector database.
